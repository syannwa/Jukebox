# Jukebox
Jukebox crreated using SwiftUI

Using SwiftUI with XCode 11, I created a simple music player application to play specific songs
that are stored in-app. The purpose of this project was to begin to get familiar with the new
interface of SwiftUI, and discover the limitations of both its functionality and its visual
design.
